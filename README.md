# Apples to apples

This project looks to implement a model that can recognise and classify images of fruit in real time.

The data used in this project can be found at the following link:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-UJPLXEM7avZUFHLPRQtDogJPnGqNVKV

## This data consists of:
* 'Fruit 360' dataset, which is available directly on Kaggle
* Flickr dataset - a set of data that I have collected, curated and labelled from Flickr
* Demonstration dataset - a set of high def images used for my capstone demo day 
* 'FruitCategories.csv' A file the lists superclass and subclasses of fruit (e.g Apple -> Braeburn)

## The project consists of 3 documents:
* Flickr Image scrape.ipynb - A jupyter notebook used with the Flickr API
* Capstone Project - Apples to apples.ipynb - A jupyter notebook detailing the EDA and modelling of the project
* Pi_DemonstrationTool.py - A .py file that was used to demo the tool
